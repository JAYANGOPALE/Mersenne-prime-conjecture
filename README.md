# Mersenne Prime Checker üåü
## Introduction üìñ

This project is a simple web application that checks if the Mersenne number \(2^p - 1\) is prime, given a prime number \(p\) as input. Mersenne primes are named after the French monk Marin Mersenne, who studied them in the early 17th century. They have the form \(M_p = 2^p - 1\) and are of great interest in number theory due to their connection with perfect numbers and their applications in cryptography. üîê

## The New Mersenne Conjecture ü§î

The **New Mersenne Conjecture** (Bateman, Selfridge, and Wagstaff conjecture) states that for any odd natural number \(p\), if any two of the following conditions hold, then so does the third:

| Condition                                                                 | Description                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **1.** \(p = 2k \pm 1\) or \(p = 4k \pm 3\) for some natural number \(k\) | Specific forms of odd numbers             |
| **2.** \(2^p - 1\) is prime (a Mersenne prime)                          | The Mersenne number is prime              |
| **3.** \((2^p + 1)/3\) is prime (a Wagstaff prime)                      | Another prime derived from \(p\)          |

### Current State of Mersenne Primes üîç

As of now, there are **nine** known numbers for which all three conditions hold:

| Mersenne Prime Numbers | Values  |
|------------------------|---------|
| Known Numbers          | 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 127 |

Bateman et al. expected that no number greater than **127** satisfies all three conditions. 

### Known Mersenne Primes and Their Values üí°

As of **2024**, all Mersenne primes up to \(2^{257885161} - 1\) are known, with none of these satisfying the third condition, except for the ones just mentioned. Primes that satisfy at least one of the conditions are:

| Primes        | 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 31, 43, 61, 67, 79, 89, 101, 107, 127, 167, 191, 199, 257, 313, 347, 521, 607, 701, 1021, 1279, 1709, 2203, 2281, 2617, 3217, 3539, 4093, 4099, 4253, 4423, 5807, 8191, 9689, 9941, ...  |

### Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

It is important to note that the two primes for which the original Mersenne conjecture is false (67 and 257) satisfy the first condition of the new conjecture (67 = \(2^6 + 3\), 257 = \(2^8 + 1\)), but not the other two. 

Primes 89 and 107, which were missed by Mersenne, satisfy the second condition but not the other two. Mersenne may have thought that \(2^p - 1\) is prime only if \(p = 2k \pm 1\) or \(p = 4k \pm 3\) for some natural number \(k\); if he thought it was "if and only if," he would have included 61.
